## Getting Started ##

hello.c:
    #include <stdio.h>

    main() {
        printf("hello, world\n");
    }

This is a simple C program! Let's break it up into sections.

> #include <stdio.h>

C programs make use of functions. Because there are so many useful functions and
definitions, they exist in *header* files. These header files allow you to use
these useful things in your programs without actually writing them all up
yourself! stdio.h includes many things already written up for you, including the
ever so useful printf().

> main() { ... }

Every C program must include a function named main(). main() is, as the name
suggests, the main function in the program. All functions include content
wrapped in braces, and they all have names. There are a lot of features to know
about functions, which you can learn more about in ../../ch4/4.1! In this case,
main() is a function which takes no arguments.

> printf("hello, world\n");

printf() is itself a (library) function that simply prints the content in (...).
In this case, it simply prints some characters. \n is a 'special character' (a
single character, in fact), which means 'new line'. There's also \t (tab), \b
(backspace), \" for double quotes (notice that \n is escaping our " - to print a
'\', it is therefore '\\'). You could theoretically have three printf()'s:
    printf("hello, ");
    printf("world");
    printf(\n);
And you would get the same output!

The ; at the end is important. in C, statements are terminated by ; - don't
forget them!

## Exercises ##

1.1: Run the "hello, world" program on your system. Experiment with leaving out parts
of the program, to see what error messages you get. (bad_hello.c)

1.2: Experiment to find out what happens when printf's argument string contains
\c, where c is some character not in (n, t, b, \). (experiment.c)
